# InclusiCareers - Client

## Introduction

Our idea for this project came from a critical question: What should the future of AI look like? Should AI's focus be limited to improving job efficiency, or is it possible to picture a time when it embraces inclusivity and equality for all? We strongly favor the latter. Only 2 out of 5 people with disabilities are employed in Indonesia, which raises concerns because their jobs may not even be adequate or equitable for them. We were inspired to develop a solution that makes use of AI's capabilities to level the playing field by this blatant imbalance and discrimination. Our project closely reflects objectives 8 and 10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations. While SDG 10 is concerned with eliminating inequality, SDG 8 focuses on promoting decent work and economic prosperity. We are also motivated to embrace Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) viewpoints, promote diversity and accessibility using AI, and provide for a range of disabilities. Additionally, our aim is motivated by Indonesia's current goal to combat unemployment and advance equality. We are driven by the belief that AI should be a force for positive change, creating a future where inclusivity and equality are not just dreams but a reality for all.
InclusiCareers is an innovative application aimed at providing equal opportunities for people with disabilities in the job market, empowering them to adapt to AI-driven work cultures. We believe that the future of AI lies in creating broad and fair opportunities for all individuals across various fields. InclusiCareers will be developed as a mobile app, catering to a diverse user base and ensuring accessibility for everyone.
